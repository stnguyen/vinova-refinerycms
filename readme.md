Vinova.sg using Rails 3 & RefineryCMS

============

Dashboard: 
URL: /refinery
Admin account: admin/admin

============

Pros & cons (over the current vinova website)

Pros:

 - Everything is controlled via the dashboard (no more manually projects portfolio, projects slide, testimonials adding)
 - Resources available for managing: 
		+ Project groups (Start-up, CMS, ...)
		+ Projects
		+ Testimonials
 - Allow choosing to show/hide a project on the portfolio page or projects slideshow.
 - Customer inquiries are manageable in the dashboard. 

Cons:

 - Contact page currently doesn't have recaptcha.
 - As a consequence of using the dashboard, batch adding/removing projects is no longer available.

=============

Need to be improved:

 - Improve views architecture (make views even DRYer, alter which code goes where)
 - Add recaptcha to the contact page.
